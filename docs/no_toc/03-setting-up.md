# Setting up for a Cohort

The DataTrail program you and your team run should be customized to your student's and staff's needs and preferences. In this section we will describe suggestions for how a DataTrail program can be run, but it is totally up to you and your team which of these examples and advice you choose to follow or not.

Setting up a DataTrail cohort:

- [ ] Identify scholars that are invited to join this cohort.
- [ ] Set up a payroll mechanism for paying the DataTrail scholars as they complete the DataTrail curriculum
- [ ] Create a barrier management plan for each scholar
- [ ] Make expectations of the program clear. Have each scholar sign a DataTrail Program agreement [See template agreement here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/142K3rVvfgjjEnog-NgIlwvbYjdGGp8du/edit)

## Identifying scholars

**Relevant Role:** Case Manager and/or non profit

Depending on the determined roles of your non-profit partnership, recruiting DataTrail scholars may or may not be one of your team's responsibilities.

## Payroll mechanisms

Ideally your non-profit partner or a non-academic institution can handle payroll in a relatively paperwork light way. It is critical that the payroll mechanism in place is truly ready to execute when the scholars have completed their first checkpoints. Recall that DataTrail is a paid program because income stability is often a barrier for entry into data science. This means scholars getting paid on time is critical not only for their stability but also their motivation. Furthermore, compensating individuals fairly and on time is something that is ethically important. Academia and other industries have often have us believe that people should be doing work because they enjoy it regardless of pay, but that is something that only income secure individuals can do.

## Learning about your scholars

Relevant Role: Case Manager

In getting to know your scholars, you will need to discuss a few things with them:

### Are they at a good place right now to commit to this educational endeavor?

### Do they display a sincere interest in Data Science?

### Is their housing and income stable enough for them to complete this program?

### Do they understand the expectations and demands of this DataTrail program?

You should have some DataTrail program agreement that individuals sign to make this clear. [See template agreement here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/142K3rVvfgjjEnog-NgIlwvbYjdGGp8du/edit)

### What kinds of barriers are they likely to encounter that may impede their ability to complete this program?

### Will some of these barriers be mitigated or nonexistent at a later point in time?

### What strategies and resources can the scholar employ to mitigate these barriers?
